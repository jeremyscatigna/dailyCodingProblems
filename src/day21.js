/*
This problem was asked by Snapchat.

Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)], you should return 2.
*/

export function minimumNumberOfRooms(timeIntervals) {
	// test case:
	// [(0, 20), (10, 50), (60 , 90), (40, 80)]
	// output 2
	// because:
	// room 1 : (0,20) - (40,80)
	// room 2: (10,50) - (60,90)
}
